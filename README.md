# Mouse-vs-Rat-Classification

This notebook is pretty straight forward. The task is to separate mouse DNA sequences from Rat DNA sequences. These sequences can be downloaded as Fasta files form different sources. N-grams are made based on the word counts of different lengths. These n-grams are then modified based on predefined conditions, and classifiers are trained on them.
